What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?
A merge takes branches and changes made in both and merges them both into one.
A rebase is like updating the branch to a commit that happened after branching out, so 
it is as if you had branched after that commit instead of before. 

What is a remote repository?
A remote repository is the online repository on GitHub that can be seen by others 
if public and not the repository on a users local laptop or local device.
