What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?
A merge happens in the main branch, and what it does is takes 
changes made in the other branch and merges it into the main branch.
So all the changes in the other branch become a part of the main branch.  
A rebase is like updating the branch to a commit that happened after branching out, so 
it is as if you had branched after that commit instead of before. It takes the commits 
from one branch and replays it onto the branch it is rebasing onto. Afterwards, 
it becomes a single linear timeline of changes made. The difference between merge
and rebase is that rebase stores the Git history in a linear timeline, but merge does not. 
After a merge is exceuted the history looks like a alternative branch line
becoming part of the main branch line, and the Git history is not linear. 
After a rebase, the Git history becomes linear since the it makes it as if 
the commits on the branch line were directly made onto the main line and turns 
it all into one linear line. 

What is a remote repository?
A remote repository is the online repository on GitHub that can be seen by others 
if public and not the repository on a users local laptop or local device.
